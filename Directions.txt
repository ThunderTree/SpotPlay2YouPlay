If you already have python and any IDE on your computer:

1. You're going to want to register for a SpotifyAPI, then replace the placeholder variables in the SpotifyAPI with your new clientID and clientSecret.

2. You need 3 YoutubeAPI, and the whole process is really well documented in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQQEaSnQ_bs&t=523s. You will find the identical code in my YoutubeAPI 1 2 and 3. I also left placeholders in the coding and commented to make it easier to find.

3. You will need to give the YouTube playlist ID in each API, there's a variable I tried to make stand out for that on each page.

4. Run the program, allow access to the google account you plan on using and that's it, it will be functional for strictly adding the new songs the program encounters. If ever you want to restart, uncomment the refresh() call on the main code page.

I tried to leave detailed comments and directions throughout and at the top of every page, look through there in case I missed something!
