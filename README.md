# SpotPlay2YouPlay

Converts new additions to a Spotify playlist to a matching Youtube playlist, can also be configured to converting whole playlists with the refresh function. Requires 3 youtube/google credentials to operate at full capacity, and needs 1 spotify api  

I built my first messy but functional Python script that converts a Spotify playlist to a YouTube playlist, while storing the song IDs locally to avoid adding the same songs twice. The default is that every time the program is run, the YouTube playlist is cleared and only the new songs are added, but this can be controlled by calling a function called refresh. You can imagine the uses, and any advice would be greatly appreciated!
